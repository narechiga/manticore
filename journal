Decided to keep a more detailed record of how things evolve.

I have a (mostly) working candidate generator. The main thing that is missing
is parsing the user annotations. I am thinking that for the simulation driven 
invariant search, perhaps the best thing to do is to simply expect that the user
provides an annotation in the form of a ball in the state space of some given radius,
and throw an error if this is not the case.

Then for a more "sampling" oriented approach I can perhaps support more general things.

:: Morning
Wrote a quick and dirty "equals" method for Term. Probably could be written to be cleaner in the future.
Also, probably some refactoring to do away with "dLStructure" is in order, because it is annoying to
have to cast all the children of Term to Term, since they are just in an array of dLStructures

1:56 pm: Abandoned the "equals" method. Equals needs to be applied on a per-operator basis to allow
for commutativity and so on. I'll do that later with some templating. Next thing to do is to strengthen
the proof generator.
Done> Clean out the settings printing function
Next> Think about how to do things better here
