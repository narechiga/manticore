Decided to keep a more detailed record of how things evolve.

I have a (mostly) working candidate generator. The main thing that is missing
is parsing the user annotations. I am thinking that for the simulation driven 
invariant search, perhaps the best thing to do is to simply expect that the user
provides an annotation in the form of a ball in the state space of some given radius,
and throw an error if this is not the case.

Then for a more "sampling" oriented approach I can perhaps support more general things.
