Invariants Prototype
====================
- This prototype takes input from the user about modes that are suspected to be stable. Tries to generate a SoS Lyapunov function for
that mode.

Full dLParser
=============
- In this version, I want to generalize to not just having hybrid automata structure. Invariants will be searched for by providing ranges
on variables, both continuous and discrete. Will start by writing a bison parser for full dL. Actually, I expect it will be simpler than
for the very detailed hybrid automaton structure I was working on before.
